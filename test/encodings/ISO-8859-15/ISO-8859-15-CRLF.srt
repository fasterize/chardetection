166
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,052
the day when I ran away...

167
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,837
Away to the big city.

168
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:07,362
The pen knife and half a loaf of bread -

169
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:10,353
and the hymnbook I got when grandma died.

170
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,054
And the comb and the watch -

171
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:15,088
and three eggs and the photo of mom.

172
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,965

173
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:20,077

174
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:26,528
Yeah, I'll never forget moms meatballs!

175
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:33,615
She made really good meat balls. Yes, she did.

176
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,640
They were one part beef and one part pork

177
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,513

178
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,588
And breadcrumbs -

179
00:27:48,678 --> 00:27:50,678
and salt and pepper.

180
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,783

181
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:55,817
And a splash of cream!

182
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,053
She knew how to cook meat balls. Yes, sir.

183
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,830
I munched away. They were wonderful!

184
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,967
Oh, and onion! I forgot onion.

185
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,658
I got a job at Holmbergs Construction.

186
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,984
I was to carry tiles -

187
00:28:45,108 --> 00:28:47,108
and beer...

188
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:49,195
to the foreman.

189
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,932
Stora Brogatan 38 was the first building.

190
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,592
I remember thinking there were so many floors.

191
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,318
His name was Lind -

192
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:20,408
but they called him Spuling.

193
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:24,283
I don't know why.

194
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,142
The entire spring and autumn.

195
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,232
And the summer in between, of course.

196
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,743
I rented a room on Södermalm -

197
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:48,855
on Svartensgatan.

198
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,629
It was a bit lonely.

199
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,219
He was a widower, foreman Lind.

200
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:20,515
He cooked his food himself.

201
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,908
He cooked and salted a leg of mutton -

202
00:30:23,986 --> 00:30:25,986
with the fur on.

203
00:30:26,937 --> 00:30:29,432
It lasted him all winter

204
00:30:30,046 --> 00:30:32,046
and he shared some too.

205
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,160
It was a cold winter, the first one.

206
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,870
Stora Brogatan 40.

207
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,880
Stora Brogatan 42.

208
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,752
The one one the corner.

209
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:27,833
I belive we started with it in the spring.

210
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,952
Come here...

211
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,874
Sven - I think he was my best friend.

212
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,352
He borrowed me a pair of pants once.

213
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,194
Well.. I haven't seen him for a long time.

214
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,150
I heard he became a sea captain eventually.

215
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,553
I remember when we were at the amusement park.

216
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,520
It was Sven and me...

217
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,039
...and that skinny boy from Värmland.

218
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,150
Oh, what was his name again?

219
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:58,578
The skinny boy, I think he was from Grums.

220
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,710
What the hell was his name again?

221
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,795
And.. Where was it that he was working?

222
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,043
I think it was a mechanical workshop -

223
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:13,111
somewhere on Södermalm.

224
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:17,037
Ah... What was his name...

225
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,122
He was from Värmland, yes he was.

226
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,542
He was from Grums.

227
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,272
His name was...

228
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,114
It was... He was...

229
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,074
Åstr... No.

230
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,740
He was strong, yes he was.

231
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,077
What the hell was his name?

232
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:46,223
That I can't remember a thing like that.

233
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,354
His name was...

234
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,194
Oh...

235
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,076
His name... was...

236
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,239
He was living on Renstjärnasgatan...

237
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,403
Somewhere in that area...

238
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,487
Why can't I remember his name?

239
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:28,912
Am I getting senile?

240
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:33,231
His name was...

241
00:39:33,697 --> 00:39:37,895
Björn Åberg was his name! That's it!

242
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,725
That was my first real bender, that night.

243
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,747
Oh, boy... Young and wild...

244
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:04,283
And then that night in Vaxholm.

245
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:06,384
Boy, how embarrassed I was.

246
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,216
We went out there, a bunch of us -

247
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:11,261
and I met this girl there...

248
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,606
Her name was Els-Marie -

249
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:16,507
or Elsa-Marie... She was a cute one!

250
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,676
I was a lovely night. The birds were singing.

251
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,745
But I had such gasses -

252
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:26,825
I never seen the likes of it.

253
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,075
I was young but with a moustasche!

254
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,081
To be handsome.

255
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:35,918
Then I saw a tin can and figured -

256
00:40:35,943 --> 00:40:38,934
if I go kick it and pass some gas -

257
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:41,077
she won't notice!

258
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:58,147
I missed it. I was devastated.

259
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,310
It was...

260
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:07,530
Björk... Björk...

261
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:14,158
Björk must not mutter for himself.

262
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,213
Björk shall get some medicin.

263
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:18,292
This will buck him up.

264
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,666
This medicine makes you spry.

265
00:41:20,722 --> 00:41:23,400
We'll have to take it every day.

266
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,037
Can't a man just sit here and think?

267
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,163
I don't think it's good for Björk -

268
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:33,209
to sit here and brood by himself.

269
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,875
- There.
- Crap.

270
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,160
I'll be right back and get Björk to the others.

271
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,072
Björk... Björk... Björk...

272
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,084
This medicine makes you spry.

273
00:42:03,196 --> 00:42:06,247
We'll have to take it every day.

274
00:42:07,113 --> 00:42:09,113
I've got an idea!

275
00:42:09,143 --> 00:42:13,273
A bottle of whisky should fit in three bottles of medicine.

276
00:42:14,591 --> 00:42:16,561
This is good.

277
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:19,150
It should be possible to systemize it -

278
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:21,206
like chain letters!

279
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:23,249
Yes!

280
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:26,415
Just like a chain letters!

281
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,764
Yes, this is great!

282
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:32,342
But with a message in the bottle.

283
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,596
Then I'd have to start with -

284
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:39,697
writing a letter.

285
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,491
A letter to the other geezers.

286
00:42:42,637 --> 00:42:44,637
To John Andersson.

287
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,689
Then I'd put Bock as number two -

288
00:42:46,754 --> 00:42:48,853
And Svensson and Arvid Kling -

289
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,264
And Gustavsson and Anna.

290
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,817
Yes, Anna should be in on it too -

291
00:42:56,897 --> 00:42:58,897
She is so kind.

292
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,432
And I'd put myself in last.

293
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,434
Yes, that's right.

294
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,221
And then... Let me see...

295
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,195
Then I'd have to write to Sven -

296
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,220
and to that other... Björn...

297
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,230
What's his name? Yes, Åberg! From Värmland.

298
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,279
And Harald Viktorin.

299
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,946
And wrap them up.

300
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,276
And then it's up to the post office.

301
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,476
And they will cross over the name -

302
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:40,471
on top and put their own name last.

303
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,398
And there will be mail to John.

304
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,282
And he'll say that he received medicine.

305
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,752
Then they'll get three people each -

306
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,044
who'll send a bottle of medicine each.

307
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,510
To Bocken, yes that's it.

308
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,116
That will be... Three times nine is twenty-seven.

309
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,233
And then...

310
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,916
Three times seven is twenty-one.

311
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,637
Eighty-one.

312
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,112
That's null.. three...

313
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,479
Two hundred and fourty...

314
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,840
Not bad! We're already up to loads!

315
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,314
So, let's see... Three... Nine it is.

316
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,839
And then... Two.. Oh, yes. And one residue.

317
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,709
That will be sevenhundred and twenty-nine.

318
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,136
And then it's my turn!

319
00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:02,192
It's me!

320
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,022
Two thousand hundred and eighty-seven bottles!

321
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,226
I hope John doesn't get mad when he only gets three.

322
00:45:32,034 --> 00:45:34,039
And I'll have all the deposit.

323
00:45:34,073 --> 00:45:36,073
That'll be lots of money.

324
00:45:36,126 --> 00:45:38,126
After all, it was my idea.

325
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:40,203
Then I'll buy myself a new hat -

326
00:45:40,248 --> 00:45:42,248
and a pair of shoes.

327
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:44,326
And maybe a fur coat.

328
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,268
And I should have a top hat.

329
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:19,182
That would not be bad at all!

330
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,476
I guess it will be my time soon too.

331
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,156
Phew. No, it can't be like that.

332
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,150
Seems gloomy that too...

333
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,678
Björk. Björk!

334
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,674
Wake up, Björk!

335
00:51:17,145 --> 00:51:19,145
Is he dreaming again?

336
00:51:19,385 --> 00:51:21,364
Get hold of yourself, Björk.

337
00:51:21,389 --> 00:51:23,389
It's stopped raining and it's time to air.

338
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:25,596
Björk may move to the kitchen.

339
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,639
Sit and think...

340
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,151
Hello, nurse.

341
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,286
Björk has got a letter -

342
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,319
all the way from America.

343
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,937
What.. Oh? What is it?

344
00:51:52,795 --> 00:51:54,795
A letter for me?

345
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:58,040
I haven't got a letter for a long time...

346
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,238
Who can it be from?

347
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,238
Who can it be that writes to me -

348
00:52:09,263 --> 00:52:11,263
from America?

349
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,608
"Dear..."

350
00:52:16,743 --> 00:52:19,778
"Dear Father."

351
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:24,912
- Shall I help Björk to read the letter?
- No, thanks.

352
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,560
"Dear..."

353
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,680
- Yes, please.
- Well, then.

354
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:35,985
It must be from my son Erik.

355
00:52:36,015 --> 00:52:38,015
He is in America.

356
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,053
I haven't seen him -

357
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:42,098
in thirty-fourty years...

358
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,518
"Dear father."

359
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:53,710
"Finally you'll get a letter from your negligent son."

360
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,431
"It was many years ago that I got in touch with you" -

361
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:03,800
- "but I've been meaning to write many times" -

362
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,000
"but there has always something in between."

363
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,438
"Me and my wife now have two sons" -

364
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,992
"that now are seven and ten years old."

365
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,994
"Named John and William."

366
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:28,714
"As I wrote, I remarried after the war"-

367
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:37,118
"and now I'm very happy with my beloved Mary Elisabeth."

368
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:44,710
"We have moved west from Jacksonville to lndiana."

369
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,951
The wild west.

370
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:53,560
"The moving was a cumbersome process" -

371
00:53:53,640 --> 00:54:01,719
"but the children enjoyed the trip. For them it was like an adventure."

372
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:08,513
"We live in the outskirts of Indianapolis"...

373
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:16,679
- lndianapolis?
- I don't know how it's pronounced.

374
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:22,711
..."lndianapolis is the capital of lndiana."

375
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,999
"And we've bought us a beautiful home here."

376
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:34,032
"It's not big, but it's enough for our needs."

377
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:41,960
"Especially Mary Elisabeth is happy here, as her heritage is from this city" -

378
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:47,957
"any many of her relatives live who are Quakers"

379
00:54:48,145 --> 00:54:53,537
- What?
- "Quakers, which I've become as well"

380
00:54:53,827 --> 00:55:02,937
- Oh?
- "I work here in a 'factori' as a gunsmith"

381
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:10,911
"I like it here and get along well with my work mates."

382
00:55:11,147 --> 00:55:18,623
"Life goes on and nothing out of the ordinary."

383
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,283
"But a month ago the president" -

384
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:26,346
"was here for an electoral meeting."

385
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,560
"He paid our 'factori' a visit too" -

386
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,157
"and shook peoples hands, including my own."

387
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:45,920
"He was a very nice gentleman who spoke common and natural" -

388
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,473
"and shook peoples hands, including my own."

389
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:55,952
"It is a beautiful area where we live" -

390
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,876
"and the wild and untamed nature is just around the corner."

391
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:08,037
"A friend of mine, George Kaminski, and me" -

392
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:13,957
"sometimes on sundays go hunting to a lake" -

393
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:22,517
"Lake Monroe is its name, and often we come home with a rabbit" -

394
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,992
"or a wild 'duck' for dinner."

395
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,350
A 'duck'? What is that? That's strange.

396
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,719
"Well, that was a few lines of how we are over here."

397
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,895
"Everything had been well" -

398
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:44,322
"if not Mary Elisabeth had fallen ill" -

399
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,075
"and have to go to the 'hospitalet'."

400
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,551
What? The 'hospitalet'? <i>(= asylym)</i>

401
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,476
"It's nothing that you have to worry about."

402
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,191
"It's a simple procedure of gallstone" -

403
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,672
"but the hospital costs a lot of money over here" -

404
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:12,679
"and therefor I ask if you could lend me 500 dollars for this purpose."

405
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,710
"I hope you can help me with this and that all is well."

406
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:23,876
"Best 'regards' from Mary Elisabeth and John and William."

407
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:29,752
"From your beloved son Erik F. Bjoerk."

408
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,898
Oh, but wasn't that was fun, Björk -

409
00:57:31,943 --> 00:57:34,665
to get a letter all the way from America?

410
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,007
Now we'll head over to the main room -

411
00:57:37,097 --> 00:57:39,097
and listen to the evening service.

412
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,573
- I can drive myself.
- No bother at all.

413
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,565
- There, Björk.
- Have you got a letter, Johan?

414
00:57:59,648 --> 00:58:02,777
- What?
- Have you got a letter, Johan?

415
00:58:02,822 --> 00:58:08,912
Yes, from my son Erik in America.

416
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,080
You have a boy in America?

417
00:58:11,114 --> 00:58:13,114
I didn't know that.

418
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,952
Oh yes. He is head of a gun factory over there.

419
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,829
- He knows the president as well.
- I'll be damned!

420
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,118
Can't you at least be quiet during the service?

421
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,194
What have you done with your life?

422
00:58:28,295 --> 00:58:30,940
When the day comes -

423
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,920
can you tell the mighty one:

424
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,560
"This is what I have done with my life."

425
00:58:37,627 --> 00:58:39,627
"I have been a good man."

426
00:58:39,714 --> 00:58:41,343
Amen.

427
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,703
We will now sing psalm 265.

428
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:32,478
Well, this is what I've done with my life.

429
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,395
A hell of a lot of houses.

430
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,992
Slaving away.

431
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,876
And now it all has to go.

432
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,435
They're just wrecking and wrecking,

433
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,999
That was it.

434
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,757
I was working with Viktorssons then.

435
01:00:11,184 --> 01:00:14,894
And at Nostins.

436
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,473
I remember that.

437
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,635
I was twenty-five when I was there.

438
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:31,357
Oh, well. Oh, well...

439
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,593
You're always out drinking

440
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,878
Everything has to go...

441
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,795
I never get any money...

442
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:52,229
I've been a good man. Yeah, right.

443
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,214
I never get any money!

444
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,260
You're just out drinking!

445
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,097
You never play with little Erik!

446
01:01:01,276 --> 01:01:03,276
You don't care about me!

447
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,969
You've stolen from my tobacco, you rascal.

448
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,047
Yes you have!

449
01:01:18,101 --> 01:01:21,286
Bah. Don't lie for your father.

450
01:01:21,315 --> 01:01:23,315
You've stolen tobacco!

451
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,337
You! Confess!

452
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:27,362
Damn scoundrel. Confess!

453
01:01:28,474 --> 01:01:31,308
Are you lying me straight in the face?

454
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,398
Maj! Come here!

455
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,111
What is it? You don't want me anything?

456
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,796
- Look here.
- No!

457
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,936
Erik ran further away than I did.

458
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:02,115
All the way to America.

459
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,672
And then he was gone.

460
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:14,438
And Maj went belly up in -42. That was it.

461
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,875
Phew...

462
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,032
And after that it's been lonely.

463
01:02:24,938 --> 01:02:26,958
That was the service. -

464
01:02:26,981 --> 01:02:28,981
Now the senior citizens talk show.

465
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,166
<i>(Jingle)</i>
A senior citizen is merry -

466
01:02:33,222 --> 01:02:37,039
remembers good times with no worry.

467
01:02:37,872 --> 01:02:39,885
Ain't nobody want to listen -

468
01:02:39,951 --> 01:02:41,951
to that mumbo jumbo.

469
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:44,444
Well, that was fun...

470
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:51,197
- Hey, let's go to your room.
- Yes, we might as well.

471
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,433
- Nurse Ester?
- Nurse Alice? We'd like to move.

472
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,111
Careful. There.

473
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:22,030
- So, you've got a boy in America?
- Yes, he's a big man there.

474
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:27,878
I'll be right back. I'll just get my bag.

475
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:33,399
Oh, nurse Ester? Would nurse mind helping me -

476
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,350
send five hundred dollars to my boy in America?

477
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,515
He's lent me so much money and I'd like to pay him back.

478
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:48,391
My bank book is in that drawer.

479
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:54,871
- Of course, I'd arrange that tomorrow.
- Most kind of you.

480
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:01,071
Thank you so much. That would be very kind.

481
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:08,511
- There! Rise and shine!
- Uh! Oh! Careful!

482
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,592
Thank you.

483
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,600
Thanks, thanks.

484
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,514
Thank you so much.

485
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:22,356
- That was good.
- Shall we get some water?

486
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,670
- Good night.
- Night, night.

487
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,911
- Some water, there.
- There you are.

488
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,471
- Thank you.
- Good night.

489
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,837
"Good night, darling."

490
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:45,137
- Maybe you could unlock this?
- Of course, I'll just...

491
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:49,198
<i>(Written on bag)</i>
May not be opened until my passing away. Johan

492
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,991
If I can find the key hole.

493
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:57,757
So, you got a boy in America?

494
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:03,757
Oh, yes. He's a big man there.

495
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,688
He knows the president.

496
01:05:06,733 --> 01:05:09,891
I'm going to send him five hundred dollars.

497
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:16,254
- That is what I'm going to do.
- I went to the park today.

498
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,280
Oh?

499
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,880
The tulips are yellow this year.

500
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,318
Have the swans arrived?

501
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,472
I was looking at the building lot.

502
01:05:35,075 --> 01:05:37,564
It's going to be a library.

503
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,692
Yes, they are just wrecking and wrecking.

504
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:46,195
Houses that have been there for hundreds of years.

505
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,551
Wrecking and wrecking -

506
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,661
and then that goddamn concrete.

507
01:05:50,673 --> 01:05:52,673
It will never last.

508
01:05:55,088 --> 01:05:59,485
No, I didn't see any swans.

509
01:05:59,518 --> 01:06:02,320
But I had a piece of bread with me.

510
01:06:02,713 --> 01:06:04,786
I gave it to the doves.

511
01:06:05,945 --> 01:06:09,040
Soon there won't be a single man who knows -

512
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,065
how to build a proper tile wall.

513
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,144
Big boxes, all of them. In my days -

514
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:16,979
you learned the trade from the beginning.

515
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:23,072
- Well...
- Well, cheers then, Johan.

516
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,356
Cheers to you, Sven.

517
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,432
Ah! Good water, this!

518
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:38,994
By the way, I cut out an ad from the paper today.

519
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,073
Just wait and hear.

520
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,120
"Amazing extra incomes."

521
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:51,958
"You can make 250 kronors a week" -

522
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,975
"by tying mats in your own home" -

523
01:06:56,031 --> 01:06:58,866
with ths. new spect. methd."

524
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:04,149
I was thinking we might start up a little industry.

525
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,076
- You, me and maybe Johan.
- You think so?

526
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,979
But it says that -

527
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:13,030
you have to buy a machine -

528
01:07:13,055 --> 01:07:15,055
and some yarn and such.

529
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,392
Do you really think your boy in America -

530
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:21,426
needs all that money?

531
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,332
Yes, yes, no, no!

532
01:07:23,366 --> 01:07:26,200
My savings are not touched for this!

533
01:07:26,425 --> 01:07:28,443
But hey, I have another idea -

534
01:07:28,468 --> 01:07:30,468
that could bring some money.

535
01:07:30,502 --> 01:07:34,709
A kind of chain letter, with whisky in medicin bottles

536
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,038
that is sent to all old geezers and old ladies.

537
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,895
In a few weeks we could make -

538
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:43,663
several thousand kronors. What'd you say?

539
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,760
- That wasn't bad at all. Cheers!
- Cheers.

540
01:07:52,414 --> 01:07:55,516
And then we move out from here.

541
01:07:56,186 --> 01:07:58,186
We go travel somewhere.

542
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:04,432
- We could go to Stockholm, right?
- Talking to me about Stockholm...

543
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:10,312
I've build half that city, oh yes.

544
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:16,156
And hey, then we'll go do some fine dining!

545
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:20,679
And then we'll go to Västerlånggatan 24.

546
01:08:20,723 --> 01:08:23,735
That's where you'll find some ladies, see.

547
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,827
That's one hot place!

548
01:08:25,861 --> 01:08:29,399
I had to run from the establishment without pants!

549
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,754
- Cheers!
- You've sure been around, Johan.

550
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:38,959
Oh, yeah. That's something else than this hole.

551
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:44,911
- And then we go to America!
- Yes! We'll go stay with your son!

552
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,214
Oh, yes. No problems.

553
01:08:47,259 --> 01:08:50,216
He's got a big mansion among the indians.

554
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:56,595
How lucky that I'm educating myself then.

555
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:01,267
"I am a boy. You are a girl."

556
01:09:01,292 --> 01:09:03,926
That's great!

557
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:07,051
You can talk to the indians!

558
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,675
That's really damn great.

559
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:13,068
Can I borrow your book? That is great!

560
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:18,440
- Cheers to that. Thanks and good night.
- Cheers.

561
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,190
- Hey?
- Yeah?

562
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:44,119
- It's not really too bad here, after all.
- Oh, no, no. "Good night, darling."

563
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,116
Good night.

564
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,675
Oh well.

565
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:23,272
Of all the colors true most beautiful is the blue

566
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:29,391
Blue is the color of the mighty sky

567
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:35,158
where nothing clouds the sun shine

568
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:40,235
Allelian-lian, allelian-lian-

569
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:46,191
- allelian-lian, harmony

570
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,637
Hadderian-rian, hadderian-rian

571
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:56,672
- addelian-lian, harmony.
